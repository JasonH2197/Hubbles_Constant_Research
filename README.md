This repository contains code and resources about my research on Hubble's Constant using bilby.

## Description
My ongoing research utilizes an independent method to calculate Hubble's constant using gravitational waves. I ran different merger event simulations and then through bayesian analysis I extracted essential data, calculating H₀ for each event. The ultimate goal is to increase the sensitivity of the existing technique of  H₀ measurement.
